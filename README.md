# Nessie
Is an automated web scraper for downloading Linux torrent files.   
Nessie comes pre-packaged with a basic, simple language to configure scraping and tons of scripts for every distro you want.   
   
## Why?
- To prevent the pain of looking up an OS's official torrent and manually downloading everything.
- To support people looking to host their own Linux distribution mirrors.
- To pull the latest versions of many OSes, all the time.
- To provide a public alternative to my private QEMU virtual machine manager, LBOX, oriented towards "real" VMs and burning to USBs.

## Requirements
- Install `aria2c` via Chocolatey or another package manager of your choice.
   
## Shortcomings
- Nessie mainly relies on FOSSTorrent to source torrents. I expect to migrate to official repositories in the future.
